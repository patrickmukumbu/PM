Welcome
=======

ProjeQtOr is a Quality based Project Organizer, as a web application.

ProjeQtOr focuses on IT Projects, but is also compatible with all kinds of Projects.

Its purpose is to propose a unique tool to gather all the information about the projects. 

The fact is that many Project Management softwares just focus on planning. 
But it is a much too restrictive point of view. 
Of course, planning is an important activity of Project Management and is one of the keys to Project success, 
but it is not the only one.

Project Managers need to foresee all what can happen, measure risks, build an action plan and mitigation plan.

It is also important to track and keep traces of all what is happening to the Project : 
incidents, bugs , change requests, support requests, ...

In this objective, ProjeQtOr gives visibility at all levels of Project Management.

At lower level, the Project follow-up consists in gathering all information, and maintain it up to date. 
This involves all the operational teams.

At upper level, Project Steering uses the follow-up data to take the decisions and build the action plan. 
This allows to bring the adjustments needed to target on the objectives of the project. 

The goal of ProjeQtOr is to be Project Management Method independent. 
Whatever your choice of the method, you can use ProjeQtOr.

What's New in this user guide version?
======================================


This section summarizes significant changes made in the user guide document for this version.

To see complete list of changes made to software, visit the ProjeQtOr web site.

Current version is V7.1 



.. rubric:: Planning
-	Managements of pool of resource

A pool is a resource that contains several resources and can therefore be allocated to projects and assigned to activities.
The pool has a capacity deducted from the resources that are assigned to it.
It is planned taking into account the individual assignment of each resource.
Conversely, each resource is assigned taking into account its participation in resource pools.
A resource assigned to a pool can automatically enter real work on activities assigned to the pool.

-	Filter on the planning

Possibility to filter the activities to be displayed on the Gantt Planning view. The "parents" of the selected activities are also displayed to maintain the WBS structure.

This chapter defines the concepts of ProjeQtOr.

They can be referred in the following chapters.

   Concept


Graphical user interface
========================

ProjeQtOr provides a very rich user interface.

It may be frightening at first glance because of the very numerous elements it provides, 
but once you'll get familiar to the structure of the interface you'll discover that it is quite simple 
as all screens have the same frames and sections always have simular structure and position.

Planning and Follow-up
======================

ProjeQtOr provides all the elements needed to build a planning from workload, 
constraints between tasks and resources availability.

The main activity of Project Leader is to measure progress, analyse situation and take decisions.
In order to ease his work, ProjeQtOr provides several reporting tools, from the well know Gantt chart, to many reports.

Real work allocation
====================

As ProjeQtOr implements Effort Driven planning (work drives planning calcuation), 
one of the key to manage project progress is to enter the real work 
and re-estimate left work for all ongoing tasks.

ProjeQtOr provides a dedicate screen for this feature, to ease this input so that entering real work is as quick as possible.
