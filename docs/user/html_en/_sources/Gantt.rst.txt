3 dependency types are managed: 

* End-Start. The second activity can not start before the end of the first activity.
* Start-Start: the successor can not begin before the beginning of the predecessor. Anyway, the successor can begin after the beginning of the predecessor.
* End-End: The successor should not end after the end of the predecessor, which leads to planning "as late as possible". Anyway, the successor can end before the predecessor. Note that the successor "should" not end after the end of predecessor, but in some cases this will not be respected:

  * if the resource is already 100% used until the end of the successor
  * if the successor has another predecessor of type "End-Start" or "Start-Start" and the remaining time is not enough to complete the task
  * if the delay from the planning start date does not allow to complete the task

.. note:: Technical points

   * This new feature will execute export on client side, in your browser.
   * Thus the server will not be *heavy loaded* like *standard* PDF export does.
   * It is highly faster than *standard* PDF export.
   * Therefore, this feature is hightly dependant to browser compatibility.
   
.. note:: Browser compatibility

   * This new feature is technically complex and it is not compatible with all browsers.
   * Compatible with IE11, Firefox, Edge and Chrome.
   * Else, the old export feature will be used.

.. note:: Forced feature activation (deactivation)

   * To enable this feature for all browsers, add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='true';** in parameters.php file.
   * To disable if for all brosers (including Chrome), add the parameter **$pdfPlanningBeta='false';**
   * Default (when **$pdfPlanningBeta** parameter is not set) is *enabled with Chrome, disabled with other browsers*
